### How My App works

You can simply create new todos, see the list of your todos, filter them by categorie or if they are not done yet.
You can see the details of your todo when you click them.
If the todo is done you can check the box.

### Database contains one table called ToDo with the attributes:
 - toDoId
 - toDoTitle
 - toDoDone
 - description
 - category
 - created
 - modified
 - deadline
 - version

### The App has the Fragments
 - BaseFragement
 - DetailViewFragment
 - InputFragment
 - ToDoListFragment

### a few closing words
At least my App is very inspired from the project in lecture and it is simple and minimalist.
Nevertheless, i had many challenges and i learned a lot.
I am very grateful for the generous help.
